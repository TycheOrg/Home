##Help Needed
- Naming: As is know the hardest part of programming is naming things.
 There are quite a number of interesting projects in the pipeline that could really use intersesting names.
 The plan for the naming theme is Greek/Roman gods.
- Logo: The org and all projects need logos.

##Current Projects
- [Tyche](https://github.com/TycheOrg/Tyche/) The core library upon which everything hangs.

##Planned Projects
- TycheCLI: A simple cli to simplify use in release piplines.
- TycheWeb: A web app.
- TycheAPI: REST interface for CI and build servers.
- TycheRelease: Desktop app for generating `Github` releases.
